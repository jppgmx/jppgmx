You know, I'm looking for new things. Even if it's not "grand," I like to look for something new. Lately, I've learned a few things like creating an OS (what I haven't learned is the stack and sectors lol). If anyone has an interest in helping me, I greatly appreciate it.

I also have a focus on the world of games, such is in the creation of mods. Which is good because it expands the functionality, the features that it could have but doesn't have officially.

Anyway, I learn fast, but I consider myself new to this world. Hopefully I can move on.
